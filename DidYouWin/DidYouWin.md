# Did You Win

This will be a small example project that will go out to the web and retrieve the latest powerball numbers and check to see if any of your numbers match. If any of your numbers match it will say how many numbers, and it will tell you if you won the Powerball number.

The functions of this little project will be as follows:

1. Open a JSON file and load up the listed powerball numbers
2. Access the lottery api and then load those numbers in a seperate JSON file that stores these numbers over time
3. Compare the original set to the set from the web to see if any match
4. If any numbers match print out on the screen how many numbers match and any winnings

Over time a history of lottery numbers will be stored in a JSON file and from there more statsistical analysis could be done in future projects

This will demonstrate the following:
1. Opening a file
2. Reading a file
3. Writing to a file
4. Accessing a web API
5. Printing the results of a comparision to the screen.

The purpose of this markdown file at this time is just to outline the purpose of this project. It will be completed if and when I have time to do so.
